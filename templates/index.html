    <h3>About this app</h3>

    <h4>Project Brief</h4>
    <p>
        Build an app that lets a sports fan keep track of their favourite sports league.

        As a huge fan of [your sport], you want to stay up to date with the league. You're interested to see which team
        leads
        the table and who won the latest games/matches/fixtures/bouts/â€¦
    </p>

    <h4>MVP</h4>
    <p>The app should allow the user to create, edit and remove teams in the league
        The user should be able to create new games
        There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
        The app should display if a game was won or lost
    </p>

    <h4>Possible Extensions</h4>
    <p>
        Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
        Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
        Anything else you can think of
    </p>

    <h4>Scott's Extensions</h4>
    <p>
        Additional stats in the league table for games won, lost, drawn, goals for, goals against, goal difference
        Add a team form indicator column in table for last 5 matches (WWWLLDD)
